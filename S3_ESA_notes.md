### Notes for South Florida HAB Observatory
#### Could be used for red tide bloom ID and on dashboards

#### Two options for processing (from ESA)
1. Start with L1 and run FLH and C2RCC operators
 - Slow, large file sizes
 - FLH is negative (using TOA radiances from L1 file)
 - Cannot run Idepix; needs tensorflow, which will only run on a windows machine

2. Start with L2 and run FLH operator
 - Use L2 cloud flag
 - Need to test 

#### Dates for testing
1. 2/6/25-2/10/25 6th and 7th are the best (Looks to be HAB along WFS near Ch. Harbor and south into South WFS)
2.
